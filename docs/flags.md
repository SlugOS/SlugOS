# Extra flags you can pass

## Compile flags
You can pass these to EXTRA_DEFINES in make.config when compiling SlugOS

```DEBUG``` This flag will put in extra logging, testing, and so on.

```RSOD``` This flag triggers a RSOD (red screen of death)

```ARCH``` This is a required flag but you can change the architecture yourself via the ARCH variable when you build.
